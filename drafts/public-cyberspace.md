{% comment %}
Visionary novels like _Snow Crash_, _Neuromancer_, and others shaped for us the idea of _cyberspace_: a collective, nonphysical-yet-real common space, a set of shared experiences mediated by networked hardware. When two people have a phone call, "[the place between the phones](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/101/101-h/101-h.htm#introduction)" is located in cyberspace. Through the 80s and 90s, the idea of cyberspace was popular as a way of explaining what systems like the internet were bringing into existence.

<iframe name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=cyberspace&year_start=1970&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ccyberspace%3B%2Cc0" width=900 height=500 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>

Somehow, as the internet itself has grown more than perhaps anyone expected, this concept of cyberspace seems somehow to be ceasing to strike people as a useful metaphor. Why?

The metaphor certainly is an apt one, as much now as ever, but in its aptness it highlights certain things we would perhaps prefer to forget: ways in which the state of the internet is much worse than the idealists of the early days would have wished.

See, once upon a time, hopes were high for cyberspace. It was a place where -- to hear the stories -- people had adventures, redefined their identities, carried out rendezvous, and generally found ways of subverting physical power structures. People devoted their lives to it. Some early hackers, netizens, phreaks, cypherpunks, and members of other such ad hoc social circles (all with cooler names than anyone would dare to use nowadays) even made declarations of citizenship of cyberspace. "[This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch](https://www.phrack.org/archives/issues/7/3.txt)", reads one particularly famous manifesto; "[Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_Cyberspace)" reads another. People sincerely and whole-heartedly believed that here was an idea which could -- which would -- change the world. 

Yet, as the modern Internet has taken shape this metaphor of cyberspace, once inescapable, has fallen off precipitously...

<iframe name="ngram_chart" src="https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=internet%2Ccyberspace%2Ccyber&year_start=1970&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cinternet%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccyberspace%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ccyber%3B%2Cc0" width=900 height=500 marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 hspace=0 vspace=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no></iframe>

...and, in a breaking of perhaps not the seventh seal but certainly no less than the fourth, the shortened term _cyber_ seems to be on the rise as a replacement (quite a surreal trend for those of us who remember what that word _used_ to mean -- but enough about that). At risk of stating the obvious, _cyber_'s edge over _cyberspace_ is its excision of the concept's spatial element: _cyberspace_ suggests a place, whereas no one seems quite able to agree on what _cyber_ suggests. The term seems to function more as a tabula rasa, onto which anyone may project their pre-existing ideas of what the internet is. Practical, but not particularly instructive.

(As an aside, the literarily-inclined might also note that the start of the brief period where 'cyberspace' overtook 'internet' in popularity lines up quite well with the publication of _Snow Crash_ in mid-'92.)

\-[_A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace_](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence)

> Cyberspace is the "place" where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. The place between the phones. The indefinite place out there, where the two of you, two human beings, actually meet and communicate.
> Although it is not exactly "real," "cyberspace" is a genuine place. Things happen there that have very genuine consequences. This "place" is not "real," but it is serious, it is earnest. Tens of thousands of people have dedicated their lives to it, to the public service of public communication by wire and electronics.

\-[_The Hacker Crackdown_](http://www.mit.edu/hacker/hacker.html)

> Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphical representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.

\-[_Neuromancer_](https://archive.org/stream/NeuromancerWilliamGibson/Neuromancer%20-%20William%20Gibson_djvu.txt)

As a metaphor, _cyberspace_ was potent in part because it captured the sheer breadth of possibilities that exist with networked technology. By suggesting an analogue to physical space, which (of course) has supported literally the entire range of human experience, the term seemed to suggest a limitless domain of new experiences, possibilities, potentialities. It's a cool thought. Fast-forward to 2018, and we've fallen a bit short of expectations: many people's experience of the internet consists of four web sites, each of which is largely comprised of screenshots from the other three.

OK, maybe that's a bit much. But grant me that bit of hyperbole and in return I'll let you in on a secret: cyberspace hasn't gone away. We've just been spending all our time building really awful spaces.

Architecturally, the modern web is built around a client-server model: data requesters (like you, loading up Twitter) and data providers (like Twitter, showing you fresh tweets). The data lives on the server; the server lives in some large air-conditioned room with armed guards; this server doles out data to clients like yourself at-will. What sort of cyberspatial construct is this? What sort of space is created between you and the service? Does the service's owner have power over you? Certainly they do -- though most major companies go to great pains to obfuscate this fact.

Early on in _The Hacker Crackdown_ , while chronicling the development of the phone network, Bruce Sterling recounts how telephone technology was first normalized:

> After a year or so, Alexander Graham Bell and his capitalist backers concluded that eerie music piped from nineteenth-century cyberspace was not the real selling- point of his invention. Instead, the telephone was about speech -- individual, personal speech, the human voice, human conversation and human interaction. The telephone was not to be managed from any centralized broadcast center. It was to be a personal, intimate technology.
>
> When you picked up a telephone, you were not absorbing the cold output of a machine -- you were speaking to another human being. Once people realized this, their instinctive dread of the telephone as an eerie, unnatural device, swiftly vanished. A "telephone call" was not a "call" from a "telephone" itself, but a call from another human being, someone you would generally know and recognize. The real point was not what the machine could do for you (or to you), but what you yourself, a person and citizen, could do through the machine.

Modern social media has learned this lesson well: while the _individual interactions_ taking place over the web are always between you and various servers, the _perceived interactions_ are between you and your friends (or enemies, if you're that particular sad sort of person). This humanization of the technology obscures the fact that the social media service's interposition into your interactions with your friends means that these interactions are effectively taking place _on private property_ belonging to not to you or your friend but to the service you are using.

There are great advantages to this centralized, business-run, private-property model. We've spent a long time getting really good at building stuff on the web, so some of these privately run spaces are actually pretty cool -- but there are also significant drawbacks. Servers aren't cheap. Most web sites have needed to make money to stay online, which turns out to be a pretty hard thing to do. Hence, the advent of online advertising, which has since been described by people who would know as [the original sin](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/advertising-is-the-internets-original-sin/376041/) of the internet. Decades down the road, we've discovered that the digital ad ecosystem is [just as bad](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html) as anything else we tried -- it just has a less obvious failure state. But the lifeblood of this ecosystem -- tracking data, the more personal the better -- has turned out to be tremendously valuable in a whole lot of ways (for more on this, there are many books I'd recommend but none as much as _Data and Goliath_, which you can find my notes on [here](https://wootfish.github.io/sohliloquies/2017/09/12/book-notes.html)).

Suffice to say that while ad-based revenue models are looking more and more like a dead-end, the tactics used to deliver targeted advertisements have turned out to be a goldmine of incredibly personal information. This information is readily bought and sold, and (needless to say) the people buying information about you rarely have your best interests in mind. It is used to [deny loans](TODO), to [raise interest premiums](TODO), to [deliver hate speech](TODO), to [single out the most vulnerable in society](TODO) for manipulation, to (when handled sloppily, as is almost always the case) out [pseudonymous performers](TODO), [members of anonymous recovery groups](TODO), ...TODO..., and more.

All this is horrifying and disgusting. It is a fundamental breach of trust, committed casually and constantly. The thing is, the market doesn't care: there's a profit incentive for companies to collect and monetize this data, so collect and monetize they do. And as long as we're spending all our time in their private corners of cyberspace, there's nothing we can do about it. It's like we're carrying out our entire social lives in a mall's highly surveilled food court, with the mall transcribing all our conversations and [selling them to the highest bidder](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/19/facebook-shared-user-data-private-messages-netflix-spotify-amazon-microsoft-sony).

One response to this issue has been to build new, _federated_ systems for social media. The idea is this: instead of having a service provided by a big, monolithic server (or set of servers) owned and operated by one company, federated systems are comprised of a number of smaller, volunteer-run servers, which collaborate to provide a similar experience to centralized web sites. Distributing responsibility in this way also distributes ownership (somewhat!), limiting the amount of data that can be collected on users. It is further assumed that altruistic volunteers are less likely to indulge in invasive tracking, as well as perhaps less technically capable of implementing it.

The move from centralized to federated sites brings with it some welcome changes. One can have a (somewhat) greater degree of confidence that the platform is respecting one's privacy. This is something like swearing off the food court and hanging out at someone's house instead: It's chill, as long as they're chill. But you're still on _someone's_ private property, so you're still trusting someone, and not to be a pessimist but [you never know what they might be up to](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/airbnb-guests-find-hidden-cameras/). Perhaps the most popular federated social media site in 2018 is Mastodon, which [is actually doing pretty OK, as these things go](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it), but which still has a long way to go before it can claim serious adoption (and they might want to find a better word than 'toot' for their version of tweets -- but then again, what do I know).

With all federated services, you make a number of compromises. You lose the certainty of a monolithic corporation data-mining everything you do or say through them, but you pick up the risk of random individual strangers trying to do the same. You also place your trust in these strangers' abilities as sysadmins, which (given that these people are almost always volunteers) is a lot of responsibility to leave on someone's shoulders. You lose the skilled, well-paid security teams of large companies -- teams who work hard every day to protect your data by making sure it gets leaked only to those who are paying for it and no one else. In their place you have some poor specific individual sucker who you just sure hope is doing their best, but who is defintely not getting paid enough for this shit.

Overall, federation represents an improvement, but it carries over a number of centralization's problems, some of which it makes worse. The story of federated systems is in many ways the story of centralized systems, but writ small and heavily repeated.

If we want to get away from this set of issues, perhaps it makes sense to get away from centralization entirely. At the polar opposite from centralized systems are _distributed_ systems, peer-to-peer networks with protocols that provide a service through the power of mutual aid.

Perhaps the most famous example of a distributed, peer-to-peer system is BitTorrent, which was recently reported to constitute [22% of all internet traffic](TODO) (for scale, Netflix claims to be responsible for 15%).

The premise of BitTorrent is this: you break large files up into small chunks, and you download all these chunks in parallel from a bunch of different people. Once you've downloaded part of a file, you can start sending those parts to other downloaders, and perhaps they will reciprocate (or perhaps they won't -- and that's ok, because there are enough generous uploaders that a few unhelpful peers don't spoil the thing for everyone). In the end, as long as the network collectively possesses all parts of the file, everyone will be able to download the whole thing -- and it'll usually go a lot faster than it would if you were downloading from a single source.

What sort of cyberspace are you taking part in when you join a BitTorrent peer swarm? The network itself is totally ad-hoc (although your introduction point to it might not be). You have no client-server relationships, only peer-to-peer. There are no mediators; no social-media giants are interposing themselves into your interactions. This is not to say you're completely secure -- you still have to trust your peers, somewhat, but the range of what misbehaving peers can do is much, much more limited than what a corporation (or even the maintainer of a node in many federated systems) is capable of.

Of course, BitTorrent is a pretty limited application. It does one thing, and does it well -- but it only does one thing. What else are distributed, peer-to-peer systems capable of? That's still something of an open question in 2018, but it's one that I'd very much like to see more exploration of.

I mentioned earlier that one sticking point with BitTorrent is getting an introduction to a peer swarm. Once you've met some peers, you're set, but getting to that point can be tricky.

The "traditional" way is via a _peer tracker_, a centralized service that peers can register themselves with and which in turn serves up a list of registered peers on demand. Not only is this a central point of surveillance, it is a central point of failure, as the Pirate Bay folks and many before them learned the hard way.

A step beyond this is to offer _mirrors_, essentially a federation of the tracker service. In this methodology, a bunch of different folks grab the same content index and start serving up their own trackers from it, essentially forcing copyright regulators (and their ilk) to start playing whack-a-mole.

A step further is to use _magnet links_. These are one step removed from magic. A magnet link is a small string, short enough to easily copy-paste or even transcribe by hand (if you're a good typist). This string defines an _address_ where one can look to get details of a torrent, and a list of peers for that torrent. But where do you look? Not on a web site, but rather in something called a _distributed hash table_ or DHT.

A DHT is essentially a very simple database that a bunch of peers collectively maintain. It works off a peer-to-peer protocol, much like BitTorrent does, but this protocol offers something different. It lets you store data (like the contact info other peers need to connect to you) at addresses (like the one you get from your magnet link), and it lets you query any address to see all the data everyone has stored there. Anyone can connect to it, anyone can store data on it, and anyone can get data from it. Some people maintain a very long-lived presence in the network, serving as reliable points for reconnection. This is where your computer goes to resolve magnet links, and honestly, the whole thing almost seems too good to be true.

To return to an unanswered question: how do we characterize such a space as this? I'm inclined to look at it as _public cyberspace_. It's like a public park or library -- something which exists because a small number of people care enough to look after it, and which therefore is available for a huge number of people to enjoy, free of cost. No one owns it -- we just coexist within it. This somehow seems to leave more space for the potential-filled visions of early cyberspace enthusiasts.

There's a reason it seems almost too good to be true: it almost is. Malicious interference in peer-to-peer systems turns out to often be very easy. BitTorrent protects against this with error-checking codes -- as long as you have a torrent file describing the file you're trying to download, you'll be able to validate every chunk of it and keep your peers honest -- but with a construct like a DHT there is no such single source of truth, no authoritative method of validation. It turns out that most existing networks are very easy to mess with, in part because no one has a full view of the system.

The _Sybil attack_ consists of deploying a huge number of peers on the network -- peers which you control, but which look like distinct entities to anyone else. This gives you a lot of leverage, and while each DHT protocol fails differently, they all do fail sooner or later. It has been proven that [perfect defense against Sybil attacks is impossible](TODO) (then again, if we're keeping score, it could be argued that perfect defense against standard threats for a large corporation is impossible too). The DHT that most magnet link resolutions go through, _Mainline DHT_, makes no attempts at defending against Sybil attacks, and experiences [many of them each day](TODO). These attacks have the potential to completely and arbitrarily censor data from MLDHT.

While perfect defense against Sybil attacks does not appear to be possible, countermeasures do exist. The Theseus DHT project, which I have been working on nonstop since early 2016, exists to explore these. The approach taken is much more analytic than most previous work, and the results this project has achieved so far are very encouraging.

A construct like Theseus DHT, if successfully realized, could provide many useful services. It could support all sorts of ephemeral data sharing and storage, serving as a data layer for entirely new app architectures. It's a natural fit, too, for making introductions to peer swarms: the fact that Theseus DHT is resilient against Sybil attacks makes it preferable to MLDHT for this purpose, as does the fact that it uses strong encryption to help protect peers' privacy even under pervasive surveillance.

What this means is that a system like Theseus DHT would be not only a powerful construct in its own right but a potential bootstrapping point for the next generation of peer-to-peer apps -- a layer on which they can build, a substrate, a common good commonly used and maintained, with common benefit. We should be so lucky as for this to be the future.
