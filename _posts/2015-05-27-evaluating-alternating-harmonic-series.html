Here's a fun little note I just found while organizing my desk. I discovered this proof during a class on infinite series last summer. The professor mentioned the limit of the alternating harmonic series, then commented offhand that "this limit is true, but we cannot prove it yet." Never one to shy from a challenge, I decided to see whether he was right, and had roughly this proof scrawled on a piece of paper by the end of class. He suggested that I try to publish it in an undergrad journal, but that didn't pan out for various reasons. Nevertheless, it's a fun proof, and I wasn't able to find it anywhere online, so I thought I'd share it here.<br /><br />The alternating harmonic series is defined as<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Eg9BDLYHZ8/VWVwM7dEFrI/AAAAAAAAALI/s8MD5G2w0vY/s1600/1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Eg9BDLYHZ8/VWVwM7dEFrI/AAAAAAAAALI/s8MD5G2w0vY/s1600/1.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>which, of course, is just the harmonic series with the sign of every other term flipped.<br /><br />It is well known that the harmonic series diverges. Slightly less well known is that the alternating harmonic series converges to a very clean limit -- strangely enough, it turns out to be ln 2. This fact, if it comes up, is usually proved just as a trivial consequence of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Mascheroni_constant">Euler-Mascheroni constant</a>'s&nbsp;most common identity. Not only is that proof beyond the reach of many undergrads, it's also so trivial as to border on inane. It's like using a sledgehammer to pound in a nail: of course it works, but is it really the best way? Someone pass me a hammer.<br /><br />Consider the following series:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YWBi3039VJE/VWVzZjdSEsI/AAAAAAAAALU/3NYTr-RqUMA/s1600/2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YWBi3039VJE/VWVzZjdSEsI/AAAAAAAAALU/3NYTr-RqUMA/s1600/2.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><a name='more'></a><br />The first few terms of this sequence are,<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-his3MePktvs/VWV07iVXDBI/AAAAAAAAALo/kobnrvS8Yes/s1600/3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-his3MePktvs/VWV07iVXDBI/AAAAAAAAALo/kobnrvS8Yes/s1600/3.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HklOnSE4IP0/VWV07lrgPJI/AAAAAAAAALk/8ZV6beCDQe0/s1600/4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HklOnSE4IP0/VWV07lrgPJI/AAAAAAAAALk/8ZV6beCDQe0/s1600/4.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GKSfqPtvqc0/VWV07oNCwNI/AAAAAAAAALg/4wOtHpsEwUE/s1600/5.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GKSfqPtvqc0/VWV07oNCwNI/AAAAAAAAALg/4wOtHpsEwUE/s1600/5.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-il6BdSF_MVw/VWV08DYIhsI/AAAAAAAAAL0/1rVQt6zdzPA/s1600/6.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-il6BdSF_MVw/VWV08DYIhsI/AAAAAAAAAL0/1rVQt6zdzPA/s1600/6.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><br />It turns out that the limit of this series as n goes to infinity is ln 2, which is kind of a cool result in its own right. If you're skeptical, try to come up with a proof -- it's a fun exercise. Spoiler alert: it's easily done geometrically using the integral from 1 to 2 of 1/x.<br /><br />Convinced? Great. Now, then -- let's do a little algebra with this sequence. Note how nicely it telescopes down.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mykp7ry6gFo/VWV4HpG_spI/AAAAAAAAAME/_GVOcGsE6UU/s1600/7.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="101" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Mykp7ry6gFo/VWV4HpG_spI/AAAAAAAAAME/_GVOcGsE6UU/s320/7.png" style="background-color: white;" width="320" /></a></div><br />This gives us the difference between subsequent terms. We know the first term, too, so let's bop the two together:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VdtCJlP4RfY/VWV6P7aT-qI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/f8YyT_Zg7bY/s1600/8.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VdtCJlP4RfY/VWV6P7aT-qI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/f8YyT_Zg7bY/s1600/8.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><br />This is a central result in our proof. In fact, we're almost done. Let's turn our attention back to the alternating harmonic series for a second. Consider its partial sums, which we'll denote by S, subscripted with the partial sum number:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aokF9JiVxco/VWV8LXlP1gI/AAAAAAAAAMc/pCDpiM3EUuQ/s1600/9.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aokF9JiVxco/VWV8LXlP1gI/AAAAAAAAAMc/pCDpiM3EUuQ/s1600/9.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><br />Notice that as the subscript grows, the difference between subsequent terms diminishes, and in fact it (of course) goes to zero in the limit. Because of this, in order to prove the limit of this series of partial sums, it would suffice to establish the limit only for terms with either even or odd subscripts. I've got a good feeling about the even ones. Let's start by matching their terms up into pairs -- S_6 is included to illustrate the idea, and then we take it out for a spin:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LrhookeZPBE/VWWKdaqbWWI/AAAAAAAAANg/HZQy4IuiEoQ/s1600/10.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LrhookeZPBE/VWWKdaqbWWI/AAAAAAAAANg/HZQy4IuiEoQ/s1600/10.png" style="background-color: white;" /></a></div><br />So our even sums are equivalent to subsequent terms of our series <i>a</i>! But, wait, didn't we already agree that we know a's limit? You know what, I think we did...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E39lk-Vl3y8/VWWC2uPJxJI/AAAAAAAAANM/hO4rCJCrDOQ/s1600/11.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="78" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-E39lk-Vl3y8/VWWC2uPJxJI/AAAAAAAAANM/hO4rCJCrDOQ/s320/11.png" style="background-color: white;" width="320" /></a></div><br />And that's it! The sequence equality could also of course also have been proved mechanically by induction, but look at this -- there really is a certain aesthetic appeal to the direct proof, isn't there?
