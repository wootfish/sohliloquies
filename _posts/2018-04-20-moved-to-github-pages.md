I decided to migrate the blog to Github Pages.

Blogger's web editing interface is a pain. Tweaking your blog's theme is a nightmare. I also dislike relying so heavily on a Google-hosted platform.

Github Pages, on the other hand, offers super easy styling and customization. You can even write posts in Markdown, using whatever editor you prefer. Github seems to be a great and reliable host, too.
