I just published Version 1.0 of the Theseus DHT Protocol specification. This is especially exciting because it just happens to be the one-year anniversary of the version 0.1 spec's publication.

The 1.0 spec contains a lot of improvements and reflects a lot of conceptual and material improvements I've been able to make over the last year. I don't expect to have to make any more changes to the spec before finishing [the actual implementation](https://github.com/wootfish/theseus.dht).

There's still a long way to go as far as implementing everything described here, but publishing an authoritative spec for reference is a big step forward and I'm very happy to be able to share it with you today.
