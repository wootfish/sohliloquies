I just published Version 1.0 of the Theseus DHT Protocol specification. This is especially exciting because it went live on Friday evening, April 20th -- which just happens to be the one-year anniversary of the version 0.1 spec's publication.

The 1.0 spec contains a number of important changes, and reflects a lot of conceptual and material improvements to the design that I've been able to come up with over the last year. I don't expect to have to make any more changes to the spec before finishing a 1.0 version of [the actual implementation](https://github.com/wootfish/theseus.dht).

There's still a long way to go as far as implementing everything described here, but publishing an authoritative spec for reference is a big step forward and I'm really excited about how far this project has come and where it's headed.
